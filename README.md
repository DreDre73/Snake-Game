# Snake-Game
This Snake Game is a personal project of mine. It offers a classic gaming experience where players control a snake on a grid, gobbling up apples to grow longer. The objective is to navigate without hitting the walls or the snake's own body. I've developed this game using the Bridges API for visualization.
