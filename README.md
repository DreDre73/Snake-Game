# Snake-Game
RamSnakeGame is a classic snake game implemented in Java using the BRIDGES API. The objective of the game is to control a snake and eat as many apples as possible without hitting the borders or the snake itself. The game features a grid-based playing board where the snake moves around and grows longer when it eats apples.

## How to Play

1. Controls:
    * Use the arrow keys (up, down, left, right) to control the direction of the snake.
    * The snake will continue moving in the last direction until a new direction is input.

2. Game Over:
    * The game ends if the snake collides with the borders of the board or with itself.
    * Upon game over, the final score (number of apples eaten) is displayed.

3. Restart:
    * Press the spacebar to restart the game after it ends.

## BRIDGES API

The BRIDGES API is a platform developed by the University of North Carolina at Charlotte for teaching students about data structures and algorithms. It provides a set of tools and libraries for visualizing and interacting with data structures and algorithms in a web-based environment.
